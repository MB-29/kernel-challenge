# Kernel methods data challenge


Our attempt for the Kaggle data challenge [Machine learning with kernel methods 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/c/machine-learning-with-kernel-methods-2021/) where we achieved 0.64600 accuracy and ranked 52th.

We implement various classification models. For our submission, we used the spectrum kernel with tuned hyperparameter `k`.
